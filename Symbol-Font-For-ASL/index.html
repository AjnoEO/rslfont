  <h4>Is this just another fingerspelling font?</h4>
  <p>No &mdash; It's more like a fun experiment.  While I certainly hope there will be people who find this project useful, the extent of its impact is undetermined.</p>

  <h5>An Old Idea</h5>
  <p>This page is less about a font, and more about an idea.  It is not a new idea, but it is an idea that many people are just now beginning to explore.</p>

  <p>Misconceptions about Deaf people and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language">
    American Sign Language</a> are sadly very common, and they can be 
    the source of real struggle and injustice. Taking just a little time to

  <h4>American Sign Language</h4>
  <p>American Sign Language is not simply miming or fingerspelling English words.  It is a real language with its own syntax, grammar, vocabulary and inflection.  And it doesn't just involve your hands, but your whole body.  </p>
  <p>In spoken language meaning is primarily conveyed through the individual words chosen, and the order they are put into.  
    It is linear.  But in ASL, individual "signs" are only part of the information.  Things like emotion, tone, nuance, time duration, pluralization, and even grammatical structure itself are all communicated through multiple things happening at the same time, in three dimensions!</p>

  <div class="boxshadow" style="padding:10px">
    <h4>Learn ASL</h4>
    <p>American Sign Language is not a written language. <br>And like most languages, you can't learn it properly by just reading out of a book.</p>
    <p>The best way to learn American Sign Language is to do two things (<strong><em>both</em> of them</strong>):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Take a class.</strong>  Contact local community colleges, colleges, and universities to find out if they have classes in ASL.  Contact local Deaf organizations to find out which schools they recommend.</li>
      <li><strong>Get involved in the culture.</strong> Attend local Deaf events, meet people, practice your signing with others.<br> Your teacher will be able to help you find the best ways to get involved.  Take their advice!</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h5>Learn the Alphabet</h5>
    <p>If you don't know the manual alphabet yet, looking at the letters in this font <em>can</em> help you, but it isn't the best way.  (That's not what it is designed for.)  The <a href="http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/gallaudettruetypefont.htm">Gallaudet font</a> is a lot clearer. A better way would be to learn from <a href="http://asl.ms/">actual photographs of hands</a>, but the best way (and the <em>only</em> way that can actually correct you if you are doing something wrong) is to learn from someone who knows ASL.</p>

  </div>
  <h4>So what can I do with a fingerspelling font?</h4>
  <p>Not much, really.  You can spell English words, look at the handshapes, and try to read them.</p>

  <h3 id="WaysToWriteASL"><em>Is there a way to write ASL?</em></h3>
  
  <p>In my opinion, no, there isn't.  Not yet.</p>
  <p>The truth is, there at least <strong>eight different ways</strong> to write ASL! So why do I say "Not yet"?  Because each of the writings systems that are out there is <em>one</em> way to write ASL.  None of them is <em>the</em> way to write ASL. </p>
  <p>You can write ASL any way you want - but it is only useful if someone else can understand what you wrote.  If most signers of ASL don't use the writing system, then whatever you write will have a limited audience. Right now, March 13th, 2013, there isn't widespread agreement on an ASL writing system.</p>

  <h4>Why not?</h4>
  <p>Some people think it is very important to have a way to write ASL.  <br>Some people think it is not needed. </p>
  <p><em>Why write ASL?</em></p>
  <p>That is an important question, and an on-going discussion.  But the purpose of this page is not to answer that question.</p>
  <p>In the last 60 years, a handful of people have put a lot of effort into developing systems for writing ASL, and many people have found their systems to be useful.  This page is about the writing systems themselves.</p>
